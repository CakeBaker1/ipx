# IPX

**IPX (IP eXpression Language)** is a lightweight, expressive protocol for parsing and interpreting user input into structured data formats like JSON. Built with performance and simplicity in mind, IPX helps transform ambiguous or hard-to-read strings into clear logical statements.

## 🌐 About

Many modern services struggle with correct user input parsing, often breaking logical operations in specific scenarios. IPX was created to address these shortcomings, introducing a standardized and extensible syntax for communication between the user and the machine.

Originally developed for [**KriX**](https://krix.world), IPX is now a standalone protocol that anyone can use, modify, and extend across any programming language or platform.

> 💡 We encourage developers to experiment, adapt, and expand the language without the burden of strict copyright enforcement.

## 🎯 Goal

Convert user-friendly query strings into structured formats that are easy to parse and reason about programmatically.

**Example:**

```
key:"value"
```

Will be transformed into:

```json
{
  "type": "MATCH",
  "key": "key",
  "op": ":",
  "value": "value"
}
```

This JSON structure can then be passed through any processing pipeline, rule engine, or search filter.
